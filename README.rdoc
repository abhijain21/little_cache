Testing implementation of cached version of has_many assoc.

* Ruby version: 1.9.3

* System dependencies: memcached

* Setup:
  rake db:setup

* Usage:
  user = User.first
  user.cached_posts # fires a SQL query
  user.cached_posts # doesn't fire a query when called second time

  Post.create(content: "Hello world", user: user) # deletes the cache
  user.cached_posts # Fires SQL again and caches the results.
